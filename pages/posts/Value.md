Recently, I read a book called Great Demo by Peter Cohan, which I think is a great read for any Sales/Solutions Engineer.
Cohan does a really great job in the key mistakes a new (or even experienced) Sales Engineer falls for and how you can you make your demonstrations more impactful rather than simply informative.

I want to break down some of the key findings that I derived from this book and how I incorporate these into my demonstrations as well, so hopefully other SEs can benefit from this knowledge as well!

# Key Points:
1. Start at the end
It is important to show the most compelling screen/handful of screens that show the solution in the strongest possible form at the beginning of the demonstrations.
One of the key focus areas here is that customers have short attention spans (this can be even more prevalent when you're selling remotely).
When beginning a demonstration you want to instantly show the propsect the end value they will get from your software, so that the rest of the demo the prospect is left wondering and trying to figure out how your software can get them to that end goal!
2. Walk through how you get to the compelling screens in a quick and concise manner
Demos should be quick and engaging.  A short and informative demo that addresses key areas of value for the customer is going to resonate a lot better than a detailed walkthrough of all the features/functionality.
3. Discovery, Discovery, Discovery
Demos should only be performated after a discovery call where the customer's Critical Business Issues are uncovered and show focus completely on how your software can alleviate those CBIs.
4. Focus specifically on customer needs
Your software probably has so many bells and whistles that you as the SE want to show off because they are so cool and useful, BUT it is extremely important to focus your demos on WHAT THEY NEED and not what you think is cool! Having a ton of features can be pretty awesome, but remember that a prospect is coming to you because they need to address certain concerns with their business and presenting features that don't directly tie to their Critical Business Issues lengthens the overall demo time as well as increasing the perceived complexity of the software.
Overloading your prospects with irrelevant features can easily lead to you upselling your customer out of the deal completely!
