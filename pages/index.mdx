# Your Name

Hey, I'm Jason Chen, a Solutions Architect at Optimizely. I am not a developer by trade, but I do love working with developers as well as marketers and Product Managers in seeing the value that experimentation can bring to both the frontend and backend of their websites.

Outside of work I love traveling, taking care of my corgi Diva (also getting her a new sister soon <3), and taking photos! Using this website to showcase some of my personal interest, which I hope you'll enjoy!

This portfolio is built with **Next.js** and a library called [Nextra](https://nextra.vercel.app/). It allows you to write Markdown and focus on the _content_ of your portfolio.

[**Deploy your own**](https://vercel.com/new/git/external?repository-url=https://github.com/vercel-solutions/nextjs-portfolio-starter&project-name=portfolio&repository-name=portfolio) in a few minutes.
