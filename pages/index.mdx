# Your Name

Hey, I'm a Senior Software Engineer at Company. I enjoy working with Next.js and crafting beautiful front-end experiences.

Hey, I'm Jason Chen, a Solutions Architect at Optimizely. I am not a developer by trade, but I do love working with developers as well as marketers and Product Managers in seeing the value that experimentation can bring to both the frontend and backend of their websites.

This portfolio is built with **Next.js** and a library called [Nextra](https://nextra.vercel.app/). It allows you to write Markdown and focus on the _content_ of your portfolio.

[**Deploy your own**](https://vercel.com/new/git/external?repository-url=https://github.com/vercel-solutions/nextjs-portfolio-starter&project-name=portfolio&repository-name=portfolio) in a few minutes.
