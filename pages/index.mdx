# Jason Chen

Hey, I'm Jason Chen, a Solutions Architect at Optimizely. I am not a developer by trade, but I do love working with developers as well as marketers and Product Managers in seeing the value that experimentation can bring to both the frontend and backend of their websites.

I am using this website to showcase some of my professional work experience as well as some of my personal interests, so you can get an idea of Jason the employee as well as Jason outside of work!
